## ⚡ How It Works

1.  **The Brain (Agents)**: A.R.E.S. employs a multi-agent system:

    - **Researcher Agent**: Digs into balance sheets (Free Cash Flow, Debt).
    - **Synthesizer Agent (AI)**: The Gemini LLM that reads all data and writes the final verdict.

2.  **The Nervous System (Bus)**: Data flows seamlessly between the Cloud Server and the Telegram Bot via a stateless JSON database, ensuring synchronization across all devices.
